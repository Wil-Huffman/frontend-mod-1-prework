Reflections:

What were your reflections from the video?

The biggest takeaway for me, was that bias is more deep-seated and deep-brain than I had thought, and examining my own biases both now and in the past, can surprise you, both pleasantly and uncomfortably.

In what ways have you examined your implicit biases before coming to Turing?

My previous career of 20 years necessitated interacting face to face with humans from literally all over the world (I was an audio engineer working with musicians, actors, celebrities, heads of state, corporate clients, artists of all types, and many others). Every day was (usually) a new show with a fresh group of people with which I was to interact.

I would not ever say that I am free of bias, because that's ridiculous. I hope that my exposure to people of most all categories of bias has maybe helped me at least iron out some of those biases to an extent.

One way that I have examined my implicit bias was by considering the times when I was surprised by an unconscious bias that I didn't even know that I had was challenged. I am thankful for the years that allowed me to have these moments, because it opened my eyes a bit to what associations I was making.

Also, I have run several of the online IAT tests on Harvard.edu. I was surprised by some results, both positively and negatively. As the reading & video material illustrates, I also follow the pattern of thinking that I am someone who is lacking in biases, yet according to the tests, I do in fact have them deep down in my brain, but I believe that being aware of them is a strength.

What kind of software do you imagine building in the future?

I would love to be a part of building the UI side of web design. I would also like to work with a team doing the same with software applications.
I do not know where the future will take me, but those are some rough ideas.

How will understanding biases (or avoiding understanding biases) impact your products?

I hope that by trying to understanding my biases, it would make my wide-view output more inclusive. By making fewer assumptions about the target end user, I would hope to have a broader aim.

Intersectionality

“All of us live complex lives that require a great deal of juggling for survival,” Carty and Mohanty said in an email. “What that means is that we are actually living at the intersections of overlapping systems of privilege and oppression.”

When you consider the way you move through the world, what elements of your identity are you most aware of on a daily basis?

The markers of privilege bestowed to me by being a straight, white, able bodied, educated male are first and foremost.  I have dealt with sometimes serious mental health issues most of my life (I am 41 years old). I am diagnosed as having depression, bipolar-2, and anxiety disorder. As much as I try, it is sometimes difficult to keep in mind that having mental illness does not define me. I am keenly aware of that everyday. I am also a recovering addict with years of sobriety to celebrate.

So, while I walk the earth trying to be aware of what advantages I have, I am also tamping down thoughts that I am "broken" and/or a "fuck up".

What strengths does your identity give you? How will you utilize those at Turing?

It's been a hell of a ride from years of substance abuse, not being close to imagining a way out & feeling absolute hopelessness, to being sober and clear headed. I learned a LOT about myself & others, and I learned to do my best not to judge people. I must have seen thousands of addicts over the years while in meetings, and realizing that addiction affects ALL groups of people was a long "WOW!" moment.

The struggle of others is most often invisible and I do my best to come from a place of compassion when interacting with people. I hope that this will allow me to be patient, non-judgmental, and cognizant of my advantages.

How do you think you could value the identities of those around you to bring out their strengths at Turing? Has there been a time where you were able to advocate or include people around you?

Compassion and patience go a long way towards making others feel comfortable interacting. In my past life, I was also a de facto instructor. Part of my job was to train men and women that were new to the job in an industry that is overwhelmingly male dominated and often brutal in its treatment of failure. I have had many opportunities to advocate & include people when they're being shut out, put down, or dealt with unfairly.

How will your strengths impact you as a teammate? What will you bring to your cohort?

I hope that my previous work and training experience, practicing compassion,  and doing my best to make people feel comfortable to share & ask questions will benefit myself and my modmates. A smile goes a long way as well. :)
